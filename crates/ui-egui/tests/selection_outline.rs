//! The selection's outline lies on the gridlines: each side covers the gridline that bounds the
//! selected cells and reaches outward from it, a whole number of device pixels wide, whatever
//! the display scale. Nothing of a gridline shows inside it.
//!
//! The grid works out where the renderer will put each gridline (`grid::gridline_span`). These
//! tests ask the renderer itself, by tessellating what was painted, so a renderer that changes
//! how it moves a line onto device pixels is noticed here.
